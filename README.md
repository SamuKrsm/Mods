# Crusader Kings III mods
This branch includes the mods I have done for Crusader Kings III

---

### Convert Resources
- Convert Resources is a mod that adds a way for the player to convert different resources into gold, which is the main currency used in the game. The game uses these “events”, which have a lot of built-in functionalities in them, thus, once one gets the hang of them, it is quite easy to create anything they desire.

### More Scandinavian Character Names
- This is a simple mod that adds more names to the name pool, from which all new characters get their randomly chosen names. It just edits a few game files that include the lists and extends on them.

### Immersive Lay with Partner
- The mod is certainly not as dirty as it sounds. As mentioned above, the game uses these “events”, to which the player needs to react. This mod then just adds a kind of roleplaying-style of conversation between the player character and their spouse, which can lead to certain results.
