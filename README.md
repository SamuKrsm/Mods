# Crusader Kings III mods
This branch includes the mods I have done for Crusader Kings III

Convert Resources
- Convert Resources is a mod that adds a way for the player to convert different resources into gold, which is the main currency used in the game. The game uses these “events”, which have a lot of built-in functionalities in them, thus, once one gets the hang of them, it is quite easy to create anything they desire.

More Scandinavian Character Names
- This is a simple mod that adds more names to the name pool, from which all new characters get their randomly chosen names. It just edits a few game files that include the lists and extends on them.

Immersive Lay with Partner
- The mod is certainly not as dirty as it sounds. As mentioned above, the game uses these “events”, to which the player needs to react to. This mod then just adds a kind of roleplaying-style of conversation between the player character and their spouse, which can lead to certain results.
