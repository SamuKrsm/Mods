# Warcraft III mods

This branch lists my mods and maps I have done for Warcraft III: Reforged.

### Combined Camera Slider System
  - A mod that adds a highly controllable camera to the game with extra UI elements. It has extra functionalities like increased zooming, panning and changing the angle  of the camera. It even adds a customizable third person camera, even though the game is from an isometric perspective.

### Explosive Blast
  - A simpler mod that adds a new ability to the game. New abilities can be added via the in-game editing tools, but this is a bit more complicated, thus, it uses the more advanced “trigger editor”. It allows modders to make mods without actual scripting, although the code underneath works just the same.
